    <h2>Columbia Giving Day</h2>
    <div class="more">
      <p>The use of social media in higher education is not new. Yet, when combined with a 24-hour fundraising event, gamification, and a robust, integrated marketing campaign designed to inspire Columbia University alumni and donors across the globe to give back, social media became a catalyst for making philanthropic history. </p><p>Since the first #ColumbiaGivingDay in 2012, growing and engaging our follower base has been fundamental in converting pride and enthusiasm for the University into the action of giving back. By leveraging #ColumbiaGivingDay messaging across scores of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts owned both by schools as well as alumni and faculty influencers, Columbians shared their support and stories about how the University had an impact on their lives. Now in 2014, applying years of insights, innovation, and optimization best practices, we were poised to launch the best performing campaign to date. 
      </p><p>
      During the third annual #ColumbiaGivingDay event this year, Columbia alumni, donors, and friends competed for a share of $455,000 in matching funds for their school or program. Social media messages reached millions. The result? Over $11 million was raised from 10,452 gifts made in 50 states and 53 countries in just 24 hours. One hundred percent of the dollars raised went to fund a range of initiatives, including school annual funds, faculty research, student financial aid, and more. What’s more, dozens of higher education institutions are now leveraging the giving day model that was developed at Columbia University, proving that imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery.</p></div>

      <h3>Facebook</h3>
      <h4>12% highest performing post engagement rates</h4>
      <p>Millions of alumni and donors of all ages and geographies were reached with the message to join in and give back through this popular channel. Turnkey social content was delivered to schools to fuel engagement for the entire month of October. Sponsored posts, school-specific strategies, and creative promotional tactics, such as “Dunk-A-Dean” videos and an autographed <em>House of Cards</em> script giveaway, proved that each school knew how to best engage their alumni and motivate giving.</p>

      <h3>Twitter</h3>
      <h4>12.4 million timeline deliveries</h4>
      <p>The urgency required to fuel a real-time fundraising event Twitter makes an ideal channel to build support quickly, particularly with influential alumni and faculty leading the way. Twice during the day, Twitter-focused #ColumbiaGivingDay challenges were announced (e.g., "The school with the most #ColumbiaGivingDay student donors in the next hour wins $7,000!"), drumming up a huge volume of tweets and an uptick in donors and gifts.</p>
